`control.py`: control script
`fgfs.sh`: FG startup script
`input.xml`: input protocol settings
`output.xml`: output protocol settings

POC is finished.
Pros:
1. It's possible
2. In some situation turn flight is done

Cons:
1. Navigation is the pain
2. Steering on different speeds is pain
3. It's hard to set speed on landing (but it's possible to set pitch
   and descend with slow speed)

Future plan:
Learn how to do it right by studying theory.
